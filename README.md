Odin Project HTML foundations project
My names Brad and this is what I've learned so far in The Odin Project.
1. HTML
    * Declaring language
        * Boilerplate
            * html lang "en" declaration
            * meta charset "utf-8"
            * head opening and closing tags
    * Paragraphs
    * Headers 1 through 6
    * Strong (strong) and Emphasized (em) text
    * Bold (b) and Italicized (i) text and not to use them
    * Ordered lists (ol), unordered lists (ul) and listing items (li)
    * How to share links (a or anchor) and href (hyperlink reference) being (a href="link here")
    * How to share images (img) and source (src) being (img src="link here")
        * Both links and images have two types, absolute and relative. Absolute leading to complete other sites/images and relative leading to other pages within your domain or images within your your own files
